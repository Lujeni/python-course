    "# Bastion hosts\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons for using bastion hosts:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - security access eg in cloud environment\n",
    "  - vpn eg via windows hosts\n",
    "  \n",
    "The latter case is quite boring as ansible doesn't support windows as a client platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard approach is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - have a ssh server or a proxy installed on the bastion\n",
    "  - connecto the bastion to the remote network (eg. via vpn)\n",
    "  - configure ssh options in ansible to connect thru the bastion\n",
    "  \n",
    "We'll do this via two configuration files:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - a standard ssh_config where we put the passthru configuration\n",
    "  - a simple ansible.cfg referencing ssh_config\n",
    "  \n",
    "This approach allows us:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. to test the standard ssh connection thru the bastion without messing with ansible\n",
    "  2. keep ansible.cfg simple in case we want to reuse them from the intranet (Eg. without traversing the bastion)\n",
